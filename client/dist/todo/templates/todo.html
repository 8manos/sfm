Similar to SFMOMA’s mission statement, Unauthorized SFMOMA Show was dedicated to making the art for our time a vital and meaningful part of public life. Unauthorized SFMOMA Show was also guided by our commitment to fostering creativity and embracing new ways of seeing the world and the institutions that aim to represent it. To fulfill this goal, we created a space where to exhibit and share the artwork that everybody wanted to see exhibited and shared.</p><h3>How were the works submitted</h3><p>In order to participate in the exhibition, the submitter went to the "I WANT TO HAVE AN UNAUTHORIZED SFMOMA SHOW" section of this website, filled in the form, uploaded her/his work in digital format (.jpg, .png or .gif) and pressed "SUBMIT". All works were immediately accepted, each submission automatically constituting an Unauthorized SFMOMA Solo Show on view at SFMOMA via the same website ( http://sfmoma.show ). Each exhibition started when a work was submitted and ended when a new work was submitted. There were NO application or exhibition fees.</p><h3>How could the shows be visited</h3><p>Unauthorized SFMOMA Shows took place at SFMOMA’s public spaces via http://sfmoma.show and thus, the only requirement to visit Unauthorized SFMOMA Shows was to be physically present at SFMOMA and have access to a device that could connect to the Internet. Once there, the visitor went to the http://sfmoma.show website to see the show -after allowing location access to Unauthorized SFMOMA Show in order to confirm her/his location. Note that public spaces at SFMOMA don’t require ticket and thus Unauthorized SFMOMA Shows were free to visit.</p><h3>Catalog</h3><p>A catalog featuring all Unauthorized SFMOMA Shows will be printed in late summer 2017.</p><h3>Contact</h3><p>If you have any questions and/or comments please don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:unauthorized@sfmoma.show">unauthorized@sfmoma.show</a></p><h3>Follow us</h3><p>In <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Unauthorized-SFMOMA-Show-275989972854131/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/unsfmomashow" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/unauthorizedsfmomashow/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p></div></div><div class="currentpast" *ngIf="currentpast"><div class="inner"><article><h1>UNAUTHORIZED SFMOMA SHOW #{{count}}</h1><h2>{{item?.todoMessage}}</h2><h3>{{item?.todoArtwork}}<span *ngIf="item?.todoDate">, {{item?.todoDate}}</span></h3><h4 *ngIf="item?.todoMedium">{{item?.todoMedium}} <span *ngIf="item?.todoSize">({{item?.todoSize}})</span></h4><h5>On view from {{item?.createdAt | date:'medium'}} through {{ '1499065199000' | date:'medium'}}.</h5></article><article *ngFor="let artwork of all; let i = index; "><h1>UNAUTHORIZED SFMOMA SHOW #{{count - i - 1}}</h1><h2>{{artwork?.todoMessage}}</h2><h3>{{artwork?.todoArtwork}}<span *ngIf="artwork?.todoDate">, {{artwork?.todoDate}}</span></h3><h4>{{artwork?.todoMedium}} <span *ngIf="artwork?.todoSize">({{artwork?.todoSize}})</span></h4><h5>On view from {{artwork?.createdAt | date:'medium'}} through {{artwork?.prev?.createdAt | date:'medium'}}</h5></article></div></div><div class="huge about" *ngIf="viewing && !submiting && !inmoma"><p class="conditional" *ngIf="warning">{{message || 'Please, allow location access to Unauthorized SFMOMA Show in order to confirm that you are currently at SFMOMA.'}}</p><p class="conditional" *ngIf="!inmoma && located">You had to be at SFMOMA to visit this exhibition.
